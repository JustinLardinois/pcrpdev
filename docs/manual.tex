\section{Introduction}
	pCRP is a conference management app that runs on Google App Engine.
	pCRP is inspired by Eddie Kohler's HotCRP, \cite{kohler} but easier
	to set up and manage because there's no need to set up your own Linux
	server, PHP runtime, and MySQL server.
\section{Setup}
	You need Python 2.7.x (I recommend CPython) and the Google App Engine
	SDK for Python \cite{gaesdk} installed on your local machine. You also
	need pip, unless you prefer to install the dependencies manually. pip
	is included with Python 2.7.9; you'll probably have to install it
	yourself if you have an older version.
