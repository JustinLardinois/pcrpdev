\section{Introduction}
	pCRP is a conference management app that runs on Google App Engine.
	pCRP is inspired by Eddie Kohler's HotCRP \cite{kohler}, but easier
	to set up and manage because there's no need to set up your own Linux
	server, PHP runtime, and MySQL server.
\section{Setup}
	You need Python 2.7.x (I recommend CPython) and the Google App Engine
	SDK for Python \cite{gaesdk} installed on your local machine. You also
	need pip, unless you prefer to install the dependencies by hand. pip
	is included with Python 2.7.9; you'll probably have to install it
	yourself if you have an older version.
	\\\\
	Clone the pcrpdev repository from
	\url{https://bitbucket.org/JustinLardinois/pcrpdev/}, then run
	\texttt{deps.py} in the root of the repository to install the
	necessary libraries.
	\\\\
	Now navigate to the Administration Console at
	\url{http://appengine.google.com/} and click \textbf{Create Application}.
	Under \textbf{Authentication Options (Advanced)}, \textit{make sure}
	to select \textbf{Open to all Google Accounts users (default)}.
	\textbf{Restricted to the following Google Apps domain} works,
	but only makes sense if all of your conference attendees all use
	the same Google Apps domain (which is unlikely).
	\textbf{Open to all users with an OpenID Provider} is untested,
	and will probably break the app; pCRP was not designed to
	support OpenID.
	\\\\
	From here, follow App Engine's documentation on app deployment
	\cite{deploy}. After deploying, your installation of pCRP can
	be accessed at \textit{application-identifer}.appspot.com.
